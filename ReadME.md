# Web-workers

Web workers are javascript's methods of implementing multi-threaded behavior into client side applications. Javascript traditionally runs in a single threaded environment, so workers are used to siphon off processes using OS level concepts.

## Brief Description

Weather app checker is a simple dashboard that is implemented using the behavior of web workers.
